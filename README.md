# ML misfits club

Hello ~~darkness my old friend~~ ðŸ‘‹    
My name is Andrey and this year I have been rejected from every research program, internship, and summer school I applied to. 
After crying into my pillow, I decided that knowledge can't just be given - you have to take it yourself; so it's time to launch my own summer (ish) school / research-padawan community ~~with blackjack and hookers~~. An educational-research community for the misfits. There'll be deadlines, rigorous homework assignments, and, most importantly, a bunch of equally passionate people right by your side.

More detailed announcement is here (in English) (TBD) and here (in Russian) (TBD).

## How to join

**This GitHub repo  has (or soon will have)**:

- Links to lectures, books, and other study materials;
- Notes distilled from discussion of completed topics;
- Homework specs plus spoiler-hidden solutions;
- Links to a chat (or chats?) for coordinating in-person meet-ups;
- An Issue for every course we're currently working through.

**How to use it**:

- Introduce yourself in the [whois](https://github.com/aigoncharov/ml_misfits/issues/1) thread;
- Pick an [interesting course from the list](https://github.com/aigoncharov/ml_misfits/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Acourse), subscribe to notifications, and join the calls or face-to-face sessions;
- If the course you crave isn't listed, create your own TODO and rally a crew the same way;
- Find a [suitable spot for in-person nerd-outs](https://github.com/aigoncharov/ml_misfits/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Alocation) or set up your own;
- Hunt for or post research ideas [here](https://github.com/aigoncharov/ml_misfits/issues/4).

**Notes**:
- Whenever possible we pick content in English to welcome all the rejected folks, whatever their language skills. Quality still comes first, though. For historical reasons and due to my origin I know some exceptional content that is currently in Russian only. So, you might see a course here and there where we go through a course in Russian. Anyone is more than welcome to join, but you will have to take care of the translation yourself.

**Hooray**! We've built a home for everyone who didn't get accepted anywhere. Time to ship it to prod-see you on the first calls!

If you've got lingering questions, suggestions, or just want to see the gang face-t-face, hop into the **[kick-off meeting](https://github.com/aigoncharov/ml_misfits/issues/7)** (or drop by in person if you're in London).
