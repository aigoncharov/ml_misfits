# ML misfits club

Hello ~~darkness my old friend~~,
My name is Andrey and this year I have been rejected from every research program, internship, and summer school I applied to. 
After crying into my pillow, I decided that knowledge can't just be given - you have to take it yourself; so it's time to launch my own summer (ish) school / research-padawan community ~~with blackjack and hookers~~. An educational-research community for the misfits. There'll be deadlines, homework assignments, and, most importantly, a bunch of equally passionate people right by your side.
